# About

Hi üëã I build and I board üèÇ *\*smile\**.

I enjoy contributing to projects I depend on, like [Ruff's Python formatter](https://astral.sh/blog/the-ruff-formatter). I build and share tools like [Huak](https://github.com/cnpryer/huak) -- an experiment with Python package management. I'm a Principal Software Engineer at [NFI](https://nfiindustries.com). You can read about some of my experience at NFI [here](https://cnpryer.github.io/building_a_digital_twin_for_a_logistics_firm/).

*Some notable highlights* of my public projects and open source contributions:
